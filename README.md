# FSharp-Practice

Here are some exercises from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) that I did
to learn a little bit about F# and functional programming. Additionally I implemented
the basic case of the Wolf Goat Cabbage (WGC) problem which can be seen 
[here](https://illuminations.nctm.org/BrainTeasers.aspx?id=4992). I also implemented the
[Johnson Trotter algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm).
These are just some basic exercises that I used to learn the semantics of F#.

To compile and run on macos, I used the following two commands:

`fsharpc <filename>.fs`

`mono <filename>.exe`
